## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust 1.70+
- Solana CLI 1.18+
- Anchor CLI 0.29+
- Phantom Wallet browser extension

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd solana-defi-vault
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # For better performance, use a private RPC endpoint:
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://your-endpoint.solana-devnet.quiknode.pro/YOUR_API_KEY/
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Set up Solana environment**
   ```bash
   # Generate a new keypair (save the seed phrase!)
   solana-keygen new
   
   # Set cluster to devnet
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   
   # Get some SOL for testing
   solana airdrop 2
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build and deploy the smart contract (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Build the Anchor program
   anchor build
   
   # Deploy to Devnet
   anchor deploy
   
   # Initialize vaults for supported tokens
   node scripts/initialize-vaults.js
   ```

## üîß RPC Configuration

### Using Private RPC Endpoints (Recommended)

For production use, we strongly recommend using private RPC endpoints to avoid rate limiting:

#### Helius
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### QuickNode
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://your-endpoint.solana-devnet.quiknode.pro/YOUR_API_KEY/
```

#### Alchemy
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Rate Limiting Protection

The application includes several layers of protection against RPC rate limiting:

1. **Request Throttling**: Minimum 1.5 seconds between similar requests
2. **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching with configurable TTL
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reused connections to reduce overhead
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to cached data when rate limited

## üéÆ Demo Instructions

### 1. **Connect Phantom Wallet**
- Install Phantom wallet extension if not already installed
- Set Phantom to Devnet network
- Click "Connect Phantom" in the app
- Approve the connection

### 2. **Get Test Tokens**
```bash
# Get SOL for transaction fees
solana airdrop 2

# For SPL tokens, you can use Solana faucets or create test tokens
# The app supports SOL deposits out of the box
```

### 3. **Make Your First Deposit**
- Select SOL from the token dropdown
- Enter an amount (minimum 0.1 SOL)
- Click "Deposit" and approve in Phantom
- Watch your balance appear in the vault

### 4. **Watch Interest Accrue**
- Interest is calculated continuously
- Refresh the page or wait for automatic updates
- Interest rate is 5% APY for SOL

### 5. **Withdraw Your Funds**
- Enter withdrawal amount (can be partial or full)
- Click "Withdraw" and approve in Phantom
- Receive your principal + accrued interest

## üí∞ Supported Tokens & Rates

| Token | Symbol | Interest Rate | Min Deposit | Status |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|

## üìä Interest Calculation

Interest is calculated using the formula:
```
Interest = (Principal √ó Rate √ó Time) / (10000 √ó Seconds_Per_Year)
```

Where:
- **Principal**: Deposited amount in token's base units
- **Rate**: Interest rate in basis points (e.g., 500 = 5%)
- **Time**: Elapsed time in seconds
- **Seconds_Per_Year**: 31,536,000 (365 days)

Interest accrues continuously and is updated on each deposit/withdrawal.
